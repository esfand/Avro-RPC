Step 1: Install dependencies

* Install Maven if you don't already have it installed.  These examples 
have been verified to work with Maven 2.0.10, but no other versions of 
Maven have been tested.

* This projects depends on one of the following versions of Avro:
- 1.5.2-SNAPSHOT or later from the 1.5 branch
- 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT or later from trunk

At the time of writing, none of the required versions have been released, 
so it is necessary first to check out and build the Avro source.  For example:

$ svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/avro/branches/branch-1.5 avro-1.5.x
$ cd avro-1.5.x/lang/java
$ mvn -DskipTests install

After installing Avro into your local Maven repository, update the Avro 
dependency in this project, if necessary.  To do so, edit pom.xml, and 
update the 'avro.version' property to be the version of Avro you just 
built/installed.

Step 2: Build/run examples
$ git clone git://github.com/jbaldassari/Avro-RPC
$ cd Avro-RPC
$ mvn test
