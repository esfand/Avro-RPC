*** Step 1: Install dependencies ***
* Install Maven if you don't already have it installed.  These examples 
have been verified to work with Maven 2.0.11.  Other versions may work but 
have not been tested.

* The example code depends on one of the following versions of Avro:
- 1.5.2-SNAPSHOT or later from the 1.5 branch
- 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT or later from trunk

By default the example code will use 1.5.2-SNAPSHOT.  At the time of writing, 
none of the required versions have been released, so I had to include a local 
Maven repository containing the 1.5.2-SNAPSHOT artifacts in lib/snapshots.  
Once 1.5.2 or 1.6.0 is released, this local repository can be removed.


*** Step 2: Check out example code ***
git clone git://github.com/jbaldassari/Avro-RPC


*** Step 3: Build/run example code ***
cd Avro-RPC
mvn test
