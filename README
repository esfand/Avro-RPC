*** Step 1: Install dependencies ***
* Install Maven if you don't already have it installed.  These examples 
have been verified to work with Maven 2.0.10.  Other versions may work but 
have not been tested.

* The example code depends on one of the following versions of Avro:
- 1.5.2-SNAPSHOT or later from the 1.5 branch
- 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT or later from trunk

By default the example code will use 1.5.2-SNAPSHOT.  At the time of writing, 
none of the required versions have been released, so it is necessary first to 
check out and build the Avro source.  For example:

$ svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/avro/branches/branch-1.5 avro-1.5.x
$ cd avro-1.5.x/lang/java
$ mvn -DskipTests install

Make note of the specific version of Avro you just installed.  If it is not 
1.5.2-SNAPSHOT you will need to update the example code's pom.xml file with the 
version of Avro you installed (see following steps).


*** Step 2: Check out example code ***
$ git clone git://github.com/jbaldassari/Avro-RPC
$ cd Avro-RPC


*** Step 3: Verify Avro version ***
If the version of Avro you build/installed in Step 1 is anything other than 
1.5.2-SNAPSHOT, you will have to update the POM in the example code to point 
to your version of Avro.  Simply edit pom.xml in the root of the example code 
checkout, and update the following line with your version of Avro:

<avro.version>1.5.2-SNAPSHOT</avro.version>


*** Step 4: Build/run example code ***
If you are not in the root of the example code (the directory with pom.xml), 
cd into that directory first.  Then simply run:
$ mvn test
